# 3SXtra

> A experimental, unsupported, unofficial fork of 3sx, a decomp of **Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike** for modern platforms — enhanced and tailored to my needs and preferences.

Most things could not be tested on all platforms, in particular MacOS and Linux. 
Linux builds are tested on a Raspberry Pi 4, running Batocera.
Flatpak builds are not yet tested. All workflows are not yet fully tested and may need updating for this repo.

Most things should work, but might need some tweaks here and there.
The training mode and Trials mode are WIP and not fully implemented.

## Quick Start

1. **Get the ISO**: You must provide your own legally obtained `.afs`  . Place it in the `rom` directory next to the executable.
2. **Launch**: Run `3sx.exe` (Windows) or `./3sx` (Linux/macOS).
3. **Controls**: Press **F1** anywhere to open the main menu and configure your controls. P1 defaults layout is WASD for movement and JKIUOP for buttons.
4. **Portable Mode**: (Optional) Create an empty folder named `config/` next to the executable to redirect all saves, replays, and settings there instead of your user profile.

## Graphics & Visuals

### Two Modern Rendering Backends
- **OpenGL 3.3+** — fully custom GPU-accelerated pipeline with GLSL shaders, texture array batching, PBO async uploads, and GPU palette conversion via compute shaders.
- **SDL_GPU (Vulkan / Metal / DirectX 12)** — a second backend using SDL3's `SDL_GPU` API, supporting the latest graphics APIs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Select the backend with `--renderer gl` or `--renderer gpu` on the command line.

### RetroArch Shader Support (librashader)
- Load any RetroArch `.slangp` preset at runtime — CRT scanlines, ScaleFX, xBR, and hundreds more.
- Hot-swap shaders from the in-game shader picker (**F2**).

### Arcade Bezels
- 40+ high-quality per-character bezels surround the viewport, just like a real arcade cabinet.
- Bezels swap automatically when characters change and reset to defaults on menus and title screen.

### HD Stage Backgrounds
- Per-stage modded multi-layer parallax backgrounds rendered at full output resolution, composited behind the game sprites.
- Assets live in `assets/stages/stage_XX/` — any stage that has assets present will use them automatically.
- Toggle on/off from the Mods menu (**F3**); falls back to the original game backgrounds when disabled or assets are absent.

### Resolution Scaling
- User-configurable output resolution — play at native monitor resolution or scale up for sharper visuals.

---

## Menus & Interface

Open overlay menus with F-keys at any time:

| Key | Menu |
|---|---|
| **F1** | ⚙️ Main Menu — input mapping, options, save/load, and more |
| **F2** | 🎨 Shader Picker — browse and apply RetroArch presets |
| **F3** | 🎭 Mods Menu — toggle HD backgrounds and visual mods |
| **F6** | 🖼️ Stage Config — per-stage visual settings |
| **F7** | 🥋 Training Options — dummy AI, hitboxes, frame data |
| **F10** | 📊 Diagnostics — FPS counter and netplay stats |

### Additional Hotkeys

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| **F4** | Cycle shader mode (rendering pipeline) |
| **F5** | Toggle frame-rate uncap |
| **F8** | Cycle scale mode (aspect ratio / scaling) |
| **F9** | Cycle shader preset |
| **F11** | Toggle fullscreen |
| **F12** | Input-lag test (Bolt diagnostic) |
| **Alt+Enter** | Toggle fullscreen (alternative) |
| **` (Grave)** | Save screenshot |
| **9** | Debug pause / frame-step |
| **0** | Toggle 72-option debug overlay |

> F1, F2, and F3 are reserved and excluded from keyboard-to-gamepad mapping so they always work as overlay toggles.

**Controller icons** — menus display the correct button icons for PlayStation 3/4/5, Xbox 360/One/Series, Switch Pro, Steam Deck, and keyboard.

**Toast notifications** — non-intrusive pop-ups for connection status, save confirmations, and other events.

**Responsive scaling** — menu text, icons, and titles automatically scale with window size.

---

## Audio

The FFmpeg dependency has been **completely removed**. Audio is decoded by a lightweight built-in ADX decoder with zero external audio library requirements.

A global **master volume** slider scales BGM and SFX together. Set it from the command line with `--volume 0–100`.

---

## Training Mode

The community's external Lua training script has been rebuilt as a **native feature inside the engine**.

- **Frame meter** — real-time startup/active/recovery/hitstun/blockstun color-coded bar; frame advantage readout after every move.
- **Hitbox display** — colored overlays for hurtboxes 🟢, attackboxes 🔴, throwboxes 🟡, and pushboxes 🔵.
- **Stun meter** — live stun accumulation during combos.
- **Input display** — on-screen input history (P1 and P2) with frame durations, toggleable with **F7**.
- **Dummy AI** — block mode, parry mode (including red parry), stun mash, wakeup mash, wakeup reversal. WIP
- **Combo trials** — step-by-step combo challenges per character, tracked natively by the engine. WIP

---

## Save System

The PS2 memory card emulation layer has been fully replaced with a modern native save system:

- **Options & Controls** → `options.ini` (human-readable)
- **System Direction** → `direction.ini`
- **Replays** → compact binary files with metadata sidecars, stored in `replays/`
- Writes are **atomic** — a crash mid-save won't corrupt your data.
- A visual **20-slot replay picker** shows date, characters, and slot status.

All files are written to your user profile folder automatically, or to a `config/` folder next to the executable in **portable mode** (see below).

---

## Netplay

Built on the upstream GekkoNet GGPO rollback netcode base, with significant additions:

- **STUN NAT hole-punching** — the client performs a STUN exchange to discover its public endpoint and punch through NAT, then hands the pre-punched UDP socket directly to GekkoNet so the NAT mapping is preserved.
- **UPnP port mapping** — automatically opens the required UDP port on compatible routers as a fallback when STUN alone is insufficient.
- **Lobby matchmaking server** — a lightweight Node.js server (zero dependencies) where players register presence, search for opponents, and exchange STUN room codes for P2P connection. Secured with HMAC-SHA256 request signing. The game includes a native C HTTP client that talks to the lobby asynchronously (non-blocking, background thread).
- **Native in-game lobby UI** — a full lobby screen inside the game, accessible from the main menu without requiring CLI flags. Shows player name / room code for internet play and LAN IP for local play. Pending connection requests are visually indicated to the receiving player.
- **Region-based filtering** — players can filter the lobby by region for lower-latency matches.
- **Client ID fingerprinting** — each client generates a stable unique `client_id` (persisted in `config.ini`) used as `player_id` with the lobby server, preventing username spoofing.
- **ImGui netplay diagnostics** — lobby browser, mini-HUD, and detailed diagnostics window with metrics history.
- **Sync test mode** — parameterized automated sync testing with Python test runner.
- **Desync prevention** — Frame 0 state reset, `WORK_Other_CONN` sanitization (F1549 fix), expanded rollback state (17 new fields), pointer-safe checksums, and per-subsystem checksums for faster triage.
- **Toast notifications** for connection events.

---

## Performance

50+ targeted optimizations — all fork-only, none in upstream:

- **SIMDe vectorization** — portable SSE2/NEON SIMD for 4-bit palette LUT conversion.
- **Texture array batching** — packs textures into `GL_TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY` for single-bind batched rendering.
- **Persistent mapped buffers** — triple-buffered VBOs eliminate per-frame `glBufferSubData` stalls.
- **PBO async texture uploads** — overlaps CPU conversion with GPU upload.
- **GPU palette compute** — hardware-accelerated palette lookup via compute shaders.
- **Active voice bitmask** — skips all silent audio channels with bit-scan iteration.
- **All game assets preloaded into RAM** — faster stage transitions, less disk stutter.
- **Hybrid frame limiter** — smooth frame pacing on Raspberry Pi (compensates for kernel timer jitter).
- **LTO + PGO** — Link-Time Optimization and Profile-Guided Optimization enabled for release builds.

---

## Platform Support

### Portable Mode
Drop a `config/` folder next to the executable and 3SX switches to portable mode — all saves, replays, and settings stay there instead of your user profile. Perfect for USB sticks and tournament setups.

### Video Broadcasting
Send your game feed to OBS or any compatible app without screen capture overhead:
- **Windows** — Spout2
- **macOS** — Syphon
- **Linux** — PipeWire _(WIP)_

### Raspberry Pi 4
Full cross-compilation support for RPi4 with Batocera or standalone Linux.

### Flatpak (Linux)
Install as a proper Linux desktop app with a `.desktop` entry and metadata.

### ARM64
Native ARM64 support — runs on Apple Silicon Macs and ARM Linux devices.
